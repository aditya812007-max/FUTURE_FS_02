# 🛒 E-Commerce Frontend Store

This is a modern, responsive E-commerce interface built as **Task 2** of my Internship at FUTURE INTERNS. It focuses on the frontend logic of browsing products, filtering categories, and managing a shopping cart.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **React.js / Next.js:** Component-based UI architecture.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** State management and logic.
* **Fake Store API:** (Optional - remove if you used hardcoded data) Used for fetching realistic product data.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Product Grid:** Fetches and displays products with images, titles, and prices.
* **Category Filtering:** Users can filter products by category (Electronics, Clothing, etc.).
* **Shopping Cart UI:** Add/Remove items from the cart with dynamic price calculation.
* **Product Details Page:** A dedicated view for individual product information.
* **Responsive Layout:** optimized for mobile shopping.
